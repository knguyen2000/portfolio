I was born and raised in Vung Tau, a beautiful city by the sea in Vietnam. My family is small—just my parents, my younger sister, me, and a baby girl corgi. Growing up in a coastal city, I always loved the water, but I also wanted to see what was far away. 

My journey started in 10th grade when I went to New Zealand for a 1-month exchange program at Freyberg High School. It was my first time being so far from home. I stayed with a local "Kiwi" family of four people. My host mom was very kind and she made amazing mutton for dinners. That was when I learned a funny fact: there were actually more lamb than people in New Zealand! 
Life for Kiwi people is very peaceful. I learned how to cook their traditional dishes and I saw how much they love rugby. Everyone was very proud of their national team, All Blacks. At Freyberg High School, I made many new friends. A very special memory was visiting a Maori village. The Maori are the indigenous people of New Zealand. I stayed in their village for a day and they taught me how to carve their traditional wood art. It was a very beautiful culture.

A year later, in 11th grade, I went to Tokyo for a summer camp at Tokyo International University (TIU). I fell in love with the food there, and I was so impressed by how polite and nice the Japanese people are. Even though I did not know Japanese, I tried my best to talk to them. Sometimes it was difficult, but people were always patient with me. 
As a fan of anime and manga, visiting Akihabara was like a dream. But Japan is also about nature and tradition. I visited Mount Fuji and many old temples. At a temple near Mount Fuji, I did draw an "Omikuji"—this is a traditional way to see your fortune. I got an "extremely lucky" paper! Looking at my life now and all the places I have been, I feel that luck has really been with me. At TIU, I lived like a local student. I learned how people study and live together in Tokyo, which was a world I had only seen in anime before. Being in a city I had dreamed of for so long was a feeling I will never forget.

For my Bachelor’s degree, I moved to Finland, and this was one of the biggest changes in my life. I lived in Tampere, which is the second or third largest city in the country. Even though it is a big city for Finland, it is very close to nature; it only took me 10 minutes to walk from the city center to a quiet, small forest. I remember learning that about 70% of the country is covered in forest, and there are lakes everywhere you look.
Living in Northern Europe taught me how to be independent, especially during the long winters. In the coldest months, we had less than five hours of daylight, which was very difficult to get used to after living in sunny Vietnam. But in the summer, everything changed. We had "White Nights" where the sun never truly goes down. I saw beautiful crimson sunsets at 1:00 AM, which was breathtaking. Another favorite memory was seeing the Northern Lights for the first time. Seeing those green and purple lights dancing in the sky made me feel like the world is full of magic.
I found the Finnish people very interesting. Finland is known as the happiest country in the world, but people are usually very quiet and reserved. They respect your personal space. However, I noticed a funny transformation: when Finns are drinking, they become the most talkative people I have ever met! That's how I manage to get "shy" Finns become my best friends and tell me their whole life story after a few drinks.
The Finnish government supports education very strongly. All citizens can go to university for free, and as an international student, I still received many benefits. The biggest one was student housing. In every big city, there is an organization for this; in Tampere, I stayed in an apartment managed by TOAS. Because of this, my rent was about 40% cheaper than the normal market price. To pay for these amazing services, the taxes are very high. There is a fixed VAT (Value Added Tax) of 24% on almost everything you buy. Even though things were expensive, I greatly appreciated the system because the quality of life and education was so high for everyone.
During my time as an undergrad, I also joined a special one-week exchange program called "Carousel Week". This took me to the Budapest University of Technology and Economics in Hungary. This trip was very special because of the people I met. I collaborated in a team with local Hungarian students and other students from all across Europe. We had to complete a three-day hackathon project. It was very intense because we did not have much time, but it was exciting to see how many different ideas we had. Even though we came from different countries and spoke different languages, we all spoke the "language of technology". We stayed up late working together, sharing snacks, and helping each other when we got stuck. I learned that having a diverse team makes the work much better because everyone sees the problem in a different way.
The local students were very welcoming. They took us around the university, which is very old and sits right next to the Danube River. The buildings look like palaces and are full of history. They told us stories about what it is like to grow up in Budapest and invited us to try their traditional food, like Goulash (a very famous beef soup). I realized that Hungarians are very proud of their history but also very open to making new friends. By the end of the week, we were not just teammates; we were friends. This experience showed me that I really love working in international environments where I can learn about the world while building something new. 

When the COVID pandemic started, I moved back to Vietnam to be with my family. I worked for two years as an IT Consultant at Netcompany. Even though I was based in the Vietnam office, the company is headquartered in Denmark, which allowed me to collaborate daily with colleagues across Europe. Over two years, I worked on different domains for different countries. It was exciting because I had to learn how different systems work. Here is a high-level look at the projects I worked on:
- **Insurance and Banking in Denmark**: I worked on a major financial services project following **[Nordea’s acquisition of Topdanmark Life (the life and pension division of Topdanmark)](https://www.nordea.com/en/press/2022-12-01/nordea-completes-the-acquisition-of-topdanmark-life)**. My main responsibility was supporting the infrastructure migration from AWS to Azure. This was a highly complex and business-critical migration, as the systems needed to remain stable, secure, and continuously available to citizens throughout the transition.
- **[Social Insurance System for the Bahrain Government](https://www.sio.gov.bh/)**: Built on Netcompany’s **[Perseus](https://netcompany.com/products/perseus/)**. I contributed to building a national system for the Government of Bahrain that manages social insurance, retirement funds, and citizen benefits. The platform plays a critical role in ensuring accurate administration and long-term financial security for the population.
- **[Mit.dk – Digital Post Platform for Danish Citizens](https://netcompany.com/mit-dk/)**: I contributed to mit.dk, a centralized, high-security digital communication platform for Danish citizens. It serves as the official digital mailbox where government authorities and private companies send legal, financial, and personal communications. Unlike standard email, this system requires rigorous authentication (integrating with Denmark’s national ID systems) to ensure that sensitive documents, such as tax returns or medical records, are delivered to the correct recipient without the risk of interception.
- **[Customs Modernization for the Hungarian Government](https://netcompany.com/ermis-for-10-european-countries/)**: Built on Netcompany’s **[ERMIS](https://netcompany.com/products/ermis/)**. I helped build the digital modules that facilitate the movement of goods across borders. This involved creating standardized electronic data interfaces that allow Hungarian customs to communicate instantly with other EU member states, automating risk management and reducing the manual processing time for trade goods.
- **[Norwegian Ministry of Foreign Affairs](https://netcompany.com/netcompany-wins-contract-with-the-norwegian-ministry-of-foreign-affairs/)**: Built on Netcompany’s **[AMPLIO](https://netcompany.com/platforms/amplio/)** platform. I helped implement a solution that allows the Ministry to manage global contracts and facilitate secure communication between the headquarters in Oslo and their various embassies and foreign missions worldwide. This required building a robust document management structure that ensures data consistency and security across different geographical locations.
One very special moment during my time at Netcompany was my two-week business trip to the company headquarters in Copenhagen. I had actually visited Copenhagen for one week back in 2020 when I was an undergrad student in Finland. But coming back after three years felt so different. In 2020, I was a student traveler, but in 2023, I was there as a professional consultant. Walking through the same streets to go to the office instead of just sightseeing made me feel proud of how much I had grown.
These two years at Netcompany were very busy, but they gave me a big sense of responsibility. Even though my teammates and I were thousands of miles apart and grew up with different cultures, our different ways of thinking actually helped us find better solutions. I learned that when we have a clear goal and trust each other, the distance between us does not matter. This experience showed me that technology is most powerful when it brings people from all over the world together to help others.

Now, I am in Virginia, USA, pursuing my Master’s degree at the University of Virginia (UVA). When I first arrived, my goal was very practical. I wanted to learn the right skills to get a good industry job in America. At that time, I did not think about research or deep theory at all. However, my direction changed in ways I did not expect. I took a Graph Machine Learning course with Professor Jundong Li in my first semester, and I became very curious about the theory behind AI. This was my first time really seeing how AI works, and it made me want to explore the area more deeply.In my second semester, my perspective changed even more. I took a course called Computer Perspectives where I heard different professors talk about their research from different areas in CS department every week. I also started attending AIML seminars. Even if I did not understand every technical detail, I loved listening to researchers talk about "open problems", which are questions that scientists are still trying to answer. I learned how to find important papers and see how new ideas are formed.
Another big influence was my Natural Language Processing (NLP) course with Professor Yangfeng Ji. I learned how "messy" human language truly is because it is full of hidden assumptions and social context. These properties do not disappear when we turn language into data; instead, they show up clearly in how the model behaves. I realized that language models are like mirrors of the data and the society behind them. Many of the problems we still see in today’s state-of-the-art language models, including hallucinations, biased outputs, and occasionally harmful responses, stem from how they are trained and what they are trained on. During pretraining, these models learn to generate text by predicting the most likely next token given a context, which rewards producing plausible continuations rather than verifying truth. As a result, the model can sound confident while being wrong, and it can reproduce social or historical biases present in its training data because it learns statistical regularities in language, not ground truth or ethical principles. This is why I am so drawn to research in Model Alignment and Explainability. I want to understand and research how we can build systems that are not just powerful, but are also reliable and responsible to the real users who use them
Another big lesson I learned in grad school is that failing is actually very helpful. In many of my projects at UVA, the results were not what I initially expected. At first, it was very frustrating when things did not work perfectly. However, I realized that these outcomes were often more informative than a quick success. When a project does not go as planned, it forces me to look much deeper into the subject to understand why. Through this process, I begin to see hidden issues that I did not notice before. These problems often become meaningful new directions for my research.

So far, I have been to 17 countries: New Zealand, Japan, Finland, Estonia, Hungary, Singapore, Denmark, Poland, Germany, Thailand, Malaysia, Sweden, Austria, Italy, France, South Korea, and the USA. Travel is a big part of who I am, it actually what shapes me who I am today. My goal is to visit 25 countries by the time I turn 30. Through all my travels and work, I have found that my favorite thing is making friends with people from everywhere.
When I am not at my desk, I am usually at the gym or hiking. I love nature, especially places with crystal clear blue lakes and snow-capped mountains.
I also love to cook. For me, cooking is an experiment. I lover "trial and error". I make a mistake, and I try again. Sometimes the food is a disaster, but sometimes it is amazing. I never give up because that is my spirit in life and in work. My favorite foods are a mix of everywhere I have been: Korean, Japanese, Thai, Vietnamese, American, Mexican, and Kiwi.
